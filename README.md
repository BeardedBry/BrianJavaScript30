Going through Wes Bos's JavaScript 30 challenge.
https://javascript30.com/

My Strategy has been to watch just the beginning of the videos and try to work out a solution on my own. And then finish the video to see how Wes did it.
This takes longer, but I believe its more fun and I learn more. Also it is interesting to see what I do the same or different from Wes.

## Project 1 - JS Drum Kit

I had a lot of fun coding this. Using transitions in CSS was new to me, as well as playing sound in the browser.



## Project 2 - CSS and JS Clock

Creating this was a challenge. I hadn't used CSS transformation or had to access the Date() object in JS until now.
At first I had tried to create the moving hands by grabbing the date, setting the hands, then using animations and keyframes to rotate 360 degrees. The clock would always end up out of sync pretty quick this way. 
Instead, it now grabs the date every second and then sets the hands to that. 

New concepts: CSS transformations, animations, keyframes, setting stlyes in JS.
