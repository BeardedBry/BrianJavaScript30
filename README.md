Going through Wes Bos's JavaScript 30 challenge.
https://javascript30.com/

My Strategy has been to watch just the beginning of the videos and try to work out a solution on my own. And then finish the video to see how Wes did it.
This takes longer, but I believe its more fun and I learn more. Also it is interesting to see what I do the same or different from Wes.
