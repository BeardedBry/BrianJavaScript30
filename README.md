Going through Wes Bos's JavaScript 30 challenge.
https://javascript30.com/

My Strategy has been to watch just the beginning of the videos and try to work out a solution on my own. And then finish the video to see how Wes did it.
This takes longer, but I believe its more fun and I learn more. Also it is interesting to see what I do the same or different from Wes.

## Project 1 - JS Drum Kit

I had a lot of fun coding this. There isn't much to say about this one. I liked organizing the code in way that made it easy to change the data, just by editing objects in my drumKeys Array.
